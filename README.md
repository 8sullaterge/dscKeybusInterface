# Post Scriptum Pc
 
 
A **postscript** (**P.S.**, **PS**, **PS.**) may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter[1] or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. The term comes from the Latin *post scriptum*, an expression meaning "written after"[2][3] (which may be interpreted in the sense of "that which comes after the writing").[4]In a book or essay, a more carefully composed addition (e.g., for a second edition) is called an afterword. The word "postscript" has poetically been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work even if it is not attached to a main work, for example Sren Kierkegaard's book titled *Concluding Unscientific Postscript.*
 
I write what happens to me every day as my diary. I don't write them on paper, but I typeset them in a word-processing system (soft diary), so **I can simply edit them and add/remove anything at any time**.

I know the application of post scriptum in letters which contains information that one wants to add to a letter after finishing it. But I'm wondering if writing post scriptum is technically sound after each entry of my diary. I doubt about it because I can edit an entry and add what I want to say to it without writing a post scriptum. However, editing needs some extra effort to find the right place in the entry for the insertion of that new piece of information. Additionally, sometimes I'd like to emphasize some important information, and post scriptum would be a good spot to put that information.
 
The discussion was closed as being primarily opinion based, but one thing to consider is that a postscript can be used as a deliberate style choice rather than just adding something at the end because you are unable to edit what you had written before.
 
I will make specific mention, however (as I did there), of Karen Hertzberg's blog post "What PS Means and How to Use It Correctly in Your Email". It expands on the idea of using postscripts stylistically.
 
In the pre-digital days, post-scripts were used because you didn't want to have to rewrite out the entire letter again. But people still use them now, even in emails, sometimes, because they serve the functions of 1) establishing an internal chronology of "this first, then that" and 2) they set something aside as a separate thought, like a parenthetical.
 
Your diary is for yourself. You can establish any conventions you want for it. But as a record of your thoughts and experiences, it is probably more useful, for personal archival purposes, to use post scripts than to edit. If you were publishing, you would want to erase evidence of the process, and just have the final result. But **for a personal archive, the post-scripting process gives valuable info about the progression of your thoughts.**
